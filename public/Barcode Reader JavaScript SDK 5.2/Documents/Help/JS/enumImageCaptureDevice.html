        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>An enumeration that represents the type of devices you used to capture barcode images.</p>
        <ul>

                        <td>The image capture device type is unknown, try EICD_Scanner first and if no barcodes were found, try EICD_Fax and then EICD_Camera.</td>

                        <td>EICD_Camera</td>
                        <td>Barcode images are captured from cameras or video devices. </td>

        </ul>
        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>This ImageCaptureDevice enumeration is used as the type for the <a href="propimageCaptureDevice.html">BarcodeReader.imageCaptureDevice</a> property and is used to determine the type of devices when reading barcodes.</p>
		<p>Barcode images captured by <b>scanners</b> may have salt-and-pepper noise. They are usually in grayscale or B&W. </p> 
		<p>Barcode images captured by <b>cameras</b> may suffer problems different than the ones captured by scanners, e.g., shadows, flash reflection, have poor perspective. They are usually in color. </p>
		<p>Barcode images captured by <b>faxes</b> are usually in B&W. </p>
		<p><b>EICD_Unknown</b> will try <b>EICD_Scanner</b> type first and then if no barcodes were found, it will try <b>EICD_Fax</b> and then <b>EICD_Camera</b>. 
		Therefore, using Unknown may naturally result in slower recognition speed. If you are not sure about the type of devices, please use <b>EICD_Unknown</b>.
		</p>
